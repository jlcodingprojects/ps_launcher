Instant Powershell Scripts.

This is a simple productivity tool which may be useful for anyone. I built it for the purpose of quickly automating common tasks in my daily workflow. For example, I have a powershell script which checks out a specific release branch, resets my local database, and runs migrations. Instead of taking several minutes to setup work on a new branch it takes about 30 seconds and I can focus on other tasks in the meantime.

Just middle click start menu to create, edit, or launch scripts. 

There are various hard coded strings in the app that you should update, such as user path or preferred IDE.
